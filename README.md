About Hgdc-X
============

Hgdc-X is a cross-platform desktop client for the Hackathon Gunther Daemon music player project.
It requires you to be running an hgd server on your local network. The official GitHub repository for the server can be found at https://github.com/vext01/hgd.

Hgdc-X is a feature complete GUI client for hgd, including SSL encryption and administrative commands. It is written in cross-platform Lazarus/Freepascal and is designed to target Linux (GTK), OS X (Carbon) and Windows (Win32). Other targets and widget sets, for example FreeBSD are possible but untested.


Building
========

Hgdc-X will build with no additional libraries (except for synapse and imagelib, which are statically linked and included in the source tree), with Lazarus 0.9.30 or later, which can be downloaded from the website at http://lazarus.freepascal.com


Binaries
========

Installers for the latest version can be downloaded from the offical website at http://hgdcx.canthack.org.
