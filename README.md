hgdc-x
======

hgdc-x is a cross-platform desktop client for the Hackathon Gunther Daemon music player project.
The official github repository for the server can be found at https://github.com/vext01/hgd.

Pre-compiled binaries are available from the "Downloads" tab above.

It is a feature complete GUI client, including SSL encryption, written in Lazarus, and is designed to target Linux (GTK or QT), Mac OS X (Carbon) and Windows (Win32 or QT). Other targets, for example FreeBSD are possible but untested.

It will build with no additional libraries (except for synapse, which is statically linked and included in the source tree), with Lazarus 0.9.30 or later.

Please refer to the COPYING file for licensing details.
Icons are from the Fat Cow icon set, which is Creative Commons licensed and can be found at http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons.

There is an IRC room at #hgdcx on irc.freenode.net. I can be found in there for any questions or conversation about hgdc-x. Commits are also posted there as they happen.

Thanks to the hgd developers for such a great music daemon, and hence opportunity for this client to exist.
Thanks to Hannah for "GUI consultancy" and Ed for Mac OS X testing.
